  <section>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how Coins ("Coins", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and safeguards information when you use
      <strong>Coins: Expense Tracker</strong> (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.
    </p>
    <p><strong>At a glance:</strong> We do <em>not</em> track you across other apps or websites, and we do <em>not</em> sell your data. The App collects only (i) performance metrics, (ii) crash/diagnostic data, and (iii) coarse location (approximate location).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1) Performance Metrics</h3>
    <p>Non-identifying analytics about how features perform (e.g., load times, screen render counts, error rates). These metrics help us maintain reliability and improve the App.</p>

    <h3>2) Crash &amp; Diagnostic Data</h3>
    <p>When the App encounters an error, we may collect diagnostic information such as device model, OS version, app version, timestamp, and limited logs around the failure. This data is used solely to identify, reproduce, and fix issues.</p>

    <h3>3) Coarse (Approximate) Location</h3>
    <p>
      With your permission, the App may collect a general, non-precise location (e.g., city/region level). We use coarse location to support region-aware features
      (like localization, regulatory compliance, or contextual functionality). We do not infer your precise movements or track you across locations.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not track you across third‑party apps or websites and do not build marketing profiles about you.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the App.</li>
      <li>Diagnose and fix bugs, crashes, and performance issues.</li>
      <li>Enable region‑appropriate functionality using coarse location.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal or regulatory requirements.</li>
      <li>Protect the App, our users, and our rights.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Legal Bases (EEA/UK users)</h2>
    <p>When applicable, we process data under these legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (e.g., ensuring the App is secure, reliable, and performant).</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> (for coarse location or where your platform requires it). You can withdraw consent in your device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligations</strong> (where we must retain or disclose certain information).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Sharing &amp; Processors</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited data with service providers (data processors) that help us operate the App, such as platform-provided analytics or crash reporting services. These providers are bound by contracts to use the data only on our behalf and consistent with this Policy. The specific providers we use may change over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also disclose information if required by law, to protect our rights, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset transfer (in which case we will take steps to ensure appropriate protections).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We keep information only as long as necessary for the purposes described above:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Performance metrics and diagnostics: typically retained up to 24 months.</li>
      <li>Crash logs: typically retained up to 24 months, or longer if needed to investigate ongoing issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may retain information longer where required by law or to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      We may process and store information in countries outside your own. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses) to protect information subject to international transfers.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
    <h3>Access, Deletion, Correction</h3>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to request access to, deletion of, or correction of information we hold about you. Contact us at <a href="mailto:5coins.feedback@gmail.com">5coins.feedback@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h3>Opt‑Out of Analytics or Location</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can disable analytics or crash sharing via your device settings where available.</li>
      <li>You can control location permissions in your device settings. If you withdraw permission, region‑aware features may be limited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>EEA/UK</h3>
    <p>You may object to processing based on legitimate interests and have the right to data portability and to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</p>

    <h3>California (CPRA)</h3>
    <p>
      We do not sell or share personal information for cross‑context behavioral advertising. California residents can request to know, delete, or correct information and to limit the use of sensitive personal information. To exercise rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:5coins.feedback@gmail.com">5coins.feedback@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided information, please contact us so we can delete it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Policy from time to time. We will update the "Effective date" above and, where required, notify you within the App or by other appropriate means.
